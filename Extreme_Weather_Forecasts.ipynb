Therefore, it is crucial to improve our understanding of extreme weather events and to predict their impacts through accurate frameworks for predicting extreme weather events ahead of time.\n",

        "The Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is the largest element of the intraseasonal (30- to 90-day) variability in the tropical atmosphere. It is a large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation and tropical deep atmospheric convection. Unlike a standing pattern like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian oscillation is a traveling pattern that propagates eastward, at approximately 4 to 8 m/s (14 to 29 km/h; 9 to 18 mph), through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. This overall circulation pattern manifests itself most clearly as anomalous rainfall. (Source - Wikipedia)."

It does not cause El Nino or La Nina, but it can contribute to the speed of development and intensity of El Nino and La Nina episodes. The MJO appears to be more active during neutral and weak ENSO years.\n",
